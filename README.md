Bus Reservation System Using Java (Loops Only)
Overview
This Bus Reservation System is a Java-based application that enables users to book bus tickets while ensuring automatic seat allocation based on age. 
The system follows a simple structure using loops (if and nested if-else) to handle logic without relying on external libraries or databases.

Key Features
âœ… User Authentication â€“ Users can register and log in using basic credentials.
âœ… Travel Details â€“ Includes destination, pickup point, seat availability, and bus operator name.
âœ… Seat Availability Check â€“ Displays available seats before booking.
âœ… Age-Based Seat Allocation â€“

Age â‰¤ 10 â†’ Lower Berth
Age 10 - 50 â†’ Upper Berth
Age > 50 â†’ Lower Berth
âœ… Simple Logic Implementation â€“ Uses loops, if-else conditions, and basic input handling.

How It Works
User Registration & Login
--------------------------
New users register with basic details.
--------------------------------------
Registered users can log in using stored credentials.
Booking Process

Users select destination & pickup point.
----------------------------------------
The system checks seat availability before proceeding.
Based on the user's age, the system assigns a lower or upper berth automatically.
Seat Allocation Logic

If the user is â‰¤ 10 years, they get a Lower Berth.
If the user is between 10 and 50 years, they get an Upper Berth.
If the user is above 50 years, they are assigned a Lower Berth.
Booking Confirmation

The system confirms the booking and displays the seat details.

Technologies Used
ðŸŸ¢ Java (Core Java) â€“ No external libraries, only loops and if-else conditions.
ðŸŸ¢ Console-Based Application â€“ Uses standard input/output for interaction.
